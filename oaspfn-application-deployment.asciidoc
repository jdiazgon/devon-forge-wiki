== OASP4Fn Application Deplyment
The deployment is performed by the serverless framework and it is quite simple, since the only command needed to deploy the full service is the following one:

[source, bash]
----
sls deploy
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
This command will fail if the AWS credentials are missing. For more information visit https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/[serverless credentials]
====

When the deploy is finish with no errors, you will have a command line output with the endpoints and the functions deployed.

Note that until now we have been working locally, so if we gonna deploy our handlers and make them work, we should change the endpoint of our services:

[source, typescript]
----
oasp4fn.setDB(dynamo, {endpoint: 'https://dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com'});
----

[NOTE]
====
You can get more information about the deployment in the https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/deploy/[serverless documentation], but be aware that OASP4Fn doesn't support the deployment of a single function.
