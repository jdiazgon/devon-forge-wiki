== Creating your First Application

In devonfw, you can create new project using two different ways:

- Using Devcon and _jumpthequeue_ Project

- Using Archetype

=== Using Devcon

You can refer the following <<Creating New OASP4J Application,Creating New OASP4J Application>> page for more details.

=== Using the Archetype

In order to create a new application, you must use the archetype provided by devon which uses the maven archetype functionality.

There are two alternatives for using the archetype to create a new application. One is to create using command line. Another way is within eclipse, which is a more visual manner.

==== Using the Command Line

===== Step 1: Open the console

Open the Devonfw console by executing the batch file _console.bat_ from the Devonfw distribution. It is a pre-configured console which automatically uses the software and configuration provided by the Devonfw distribution.

===== Step 2: Change the directory

You can create the project anywhere you want, but it is a good practice to create the projects in your `workspace` directory. Therefore, run the following command in the console to change to the directory to `workspaces\main`.

[source,bash]
----
cd workspaces\main
----

This is the default location on Devonfw to create new applications. It is also possible to have your own workspace.

===== Step 3: Create the new application

To create a new application, you need to execute one of the following commands:


** WAR packaging (arguments before archetype:generate identify the OASP4J archetype):
+
[source,bash]
---- 
mvn -DarchetypeVersion=<OASP4J-VERSION> -DarchetypeGroupId=io.oasp.java.templates -DarchetypeArtifactId=oasp4j-template-server archetype:generate -DgroupId=<APPLICATION-GROUP-ID> -DartifactId=<APPLICATION-ARTIFACT-ID> -Dversion=<APPLICATION-VERSION> -Dpackage=<APPLICATION-PACKAGE-NAME> -DdbType=<DBTYPE>
---- 
+
For example 
+
[source,bash]
---- 
mvn -DarchetypeVersion=2.5.0 -DarchetypeGroupId=io.oasp.java.templates -DarchetypeArtifactId=oasp4j-template-server archetype:generate -DgroupId=io.oasp.application -DartifactId=sampleapp -Dversion=0.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=io.oasp.application.sampleapp -DdbType=h2
---- 
//////////////////////////////////////////
** And for combined WAR and EAR packaging (arguments before archetype:generate identify the OASP4J archetype):
+
[source]
---- 
mvn -DarchetypeVersion=2.1.0 -DarchetypeGroupId=io.oasp.java.templates -DarchetypeArtifactId=oasp4j-template-server archetype:generate -DgroupId=io.oasp.application -DartifactId=sampleapp -Dversion=0.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=io.oasp.application.sampleapp -DearProjectName=enterprise-ear
---- 
//////////////////////////////////////////
This will create a new directory inside `workspaces\main` with the name of your application with the created application inside.

==== Using the Eclipse

[NOTE]
====
If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, then the above steps will not work as Eclipse has a known bug where the archetype discovery does not work behind a proxy. In this case, please use the command line version documented above.
====

To create a new application using Eclipse, you should have installed https://coconet.capgemini.com/sf/frs/do/listReleases/projects.apps2_devon/frs.devon_distribution[Devonfw distribution]. Then, follow below steps to create a new application:

===== Step 1 - Create a new Maven Project

Open Eclipse from a Devonfw distribution, by executing the batch file _eclipse-main.bat_, then go to _File > New > Maven Project_. If you don't see the option, click _File > New > Other_ and use the filter to search the option _Maven Project_

===== Step 2 -  Choose the archetype

In the New Maven Project wizard, you need to choose the _oas4j-template-server archetype_, as shown in below image.

[NOTE]
====
If you are not able to access the archetype even after checking the _Include snapshot archetypes_ option, then try adding the archetype repository manually. You can do it with the _Configure_ button located next to the _Catalogs_ dropdown and then clicking the _Add Remote Catalog_ button. Finally, you need to add the repository URL _https://repo1.maven.org/maven2_ and as _Description_ you can use _Maven Central_.

image::images/create-new-app/devon-guide-newapp-add-archetype.png[,width="450", link="images/create-new-app/devon-guide-newapp-add-archetype.png"]

Use the _Verify_ button to check the connection. Subsequently, you will see a message with the amount of found archetypes.   
====


[Archetype]

===== Step 3 - Configure the application properties

Fill the _Group Id_, _Artifact Id_, _Version_ and _Package_ for your project. Also in _Properties available from archetype_ section update dbtype as required
//////////////////////////////////////////
If you want to add an EAR generation mechanism to your project, you should fill the property _earProjectName_ with the value _Artifact Id_ + _-ear_. For example, _sampleapp-ear_. 

If you only want a WAR generation, you can remove the property _earProjectName_.

* Click on the Finish button and the project will be ready for execution.
