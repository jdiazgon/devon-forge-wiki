== OASP4J Architecture

OASP4J provides a solution for industrialized web apps based on _components_ and a three-layers architecture.

A _component_ is a package that contains the services and logic related to one feature of the app.

Each component will be divided in three layers: _service_, _logic_ and _dataacess_.

- Service Layer: will expose the REST api to exchange information with the client applications.

- Logic Layer: the layer in charge of hosting the business logic of the application.

- Data Access Layer: the layer to communicate with the data base.

Finally the _Oasp4j_ applications provide a _general_ package to locate the cross-cutting functionalities such as _security_, _logging_ or _exception handling_.
