== Using Oomph in the IDE

In this section we'll give a guide on how to use Oomph in your workflow. This tutorial assumes that you use a devon-ide based Oomph Product.

In this section we work with the _Oomph Tool Bar_. In the devon-ide based Oomph Products this bar is enabled by default. If not you can enable it with the _Show tool bar contributions_ checkbox  in the Eclipse Preferences -> Oomph -> Setup Tasks.

The _Oomph Tool Bar_ looks like this

=== Checking out a Project

. Create a new _Workspace_ (Create an folder inside of `./workspaces` and call `update-all-workspaces`). This step is optional. You can also import the project in any pre existing workspace.
. Start Eclipse with the target Workspace (the `eclipse-....bat` script).
. Select _Import Projects..._ from the _Oomph Tool Bar_. This will open the _Project Page_ (see <<IDE Setup with the Oomph Installer,IDE-Setup with Oomph>> for a pictured Walkthrough).
. Select the Project(s) to import and their Streams and proceed.
. Fill out the variables and proceed. Make sure that the _Show all variables_ check box is activated and that the _Workspace for ... _ variable is set to the current Workspace.
. Oomph will now set up the Project according to it's definition. The Wizard will close automatically but can be brought back with the _Setup Task Progess Indicator_.

=== Updating a Oomph based Product and Project

By default every devon-ide based Oomph Product has the Setup Task check at each start enabled. If not you can enable (or disable if you don't want it at every start of Eclipse) with the _Skip automatic task execution at startup time_ check box in the Eclipse Preferences -> Oomph -> Setup Tasks.

At each Eclipse start the `STARTUP` trigger is fired and every task responding to that trigger is executed. If the Product or Project is changed Eclipse will work according to this changes. Product and Project are only referenced in the Eclipse Installation.

If you want to trigger an update by yourself select _Perform Setup Tasks..._ from the _Oomph Tool Bar_.
