== OASP UI

+OASP UI+ provides components which will make your application more responsive. The module contains such elements as +oaspGrid+ which helps you in creating layout of your dialogs' templates, +buttonBar+ which is a widget for grouping control buttons in a bar, +modal+ which supports you in implementing modal dialogs and +spinner+ for handling long running tasks.

In order to use any of the +OASP UI+ components you need to install the +oasp4js ng-modules+ library. Please refer to the https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js-bower[home page] of the oasp4js repository for details how to do it.

Below you can find the examples of how to use +OASP UI+ components in your application.

=== Spinner

The spinner should be used whenever there is a long running task performed - it tells the user that a task is in progress and prevents him / her from performing some additional actions which could inappropriately influence the long running task. When the task is completed, then the spinner is hidden and control is returned to the user. The main example where spinner comes with help is handling the requests to the server which usually take more time.

The screen below shows the spinner launched when the the user signs into the +oasp4js+ sample application:

==== API

The +oasp.oaspUi.spinner+ spinner module provides the +globalSpinner+ service with the following API:

* +show()+ - shows the spinner
* +hide()+ - hides the spinner
* +showOnRouteChangeStartAndHideWhenComplete()+ - shows spinner on the route is being changed, hides it when the route change is completed
* +decorateCallOfFunctionReturningPromise(fn)+ - shows spinner when the +fn+ (function returning promise) is called and hides it when the promise is resolved or rejected

==== Getting spinner working in your application

It is assumed that you have already installed the +oasp4js ng-modules+ in your application.

The next step is to add spinner module dependency into your AngularJS application:

[source,javascript]
----
angular.module('myApp', ['oasp.oaspUi.spinner', ...])
----

You have to call the spinner directive in your main html file, anywhere in the +<body>+ tag:
[source,html]
----
<div data-spinner="globalSpinner"></div>
----

The next step is to inject the +globalSpinner+ service into controller where you want to use it:

[source,javascript]
----
angular.module('myApp').controller('AppCntl', function ($scope, globalSpinner) {
    //controller's code goes here
});
----

It is also required to attach the spinner's css sources which are placed under the following path after the +ng-modules+ installation:

+<app_dir>/bower_components/oasp/oasp/oasp-ui/css/components/spinner+


When you are using the +OASP4JS Application Template+ it is enough when you add the following import to the +main.less+ file:

[source, css]
----
@import "bower_components/oasp/oasp/oasp-ui/css/components/spinner";
----

When you do that you can use the +globalSpinner+ API.
