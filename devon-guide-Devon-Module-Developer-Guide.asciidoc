== Devon module Developer's Guide

Here, we intend to explain, creation of a maven module (devonfw module), which will serve as template for creating the other modules.
This is done with the usage of maven archetype plugin. Please, follow the subsequent sections, for creation of the same.

=== Creation of module template

The maven Archetype Plugin allows the user to create a Maven project from an existing template called an archetype.
It also allows the user to create an archetype from an existing project.

Creating an archetype from an existing project involves three steps:

* the archetype resolution
* the archetype installation:deployment
* the archetype usage

*1.* Using devon distribution's, _console.bat_, open console and go to directory where project exists, and then execute the command:
 
[source,java]
----
mvn archetype:create-from-project
----

*2.* It then generates the directory tree of the archetype in the _target/generated-sources/archetype_ directory.

*3.* Then, move to the mentioned directory above and execute,

[source,java]
----
mvn install
----

So, this step installs the created archetype in users local maven repository.

=== Usage

One can use this archetype to create maven modules/projects with:

* Eclipse
* From command line

==== Creation of module/project using Eclipse

If one wants to create project using archetype in Eclipse, follow below steps:

Go to File --> New --> Maven Project

image::images/devon-module-dev-guide/create-project-eclipse.png["create project in eclipse",width="450", link="images/devon-module-dev-guide/create-project-eclipse.png"]

Click on the Next button.

image::images/devon-module-dev-guide/new-maven-project.png/["create new maven project in eclipse",width="450", link="images/devon-module-dev-guide/new-maven-project.png"]

Select archetype.

image::images/devon-module-dev-guide/select-archetype.png/["select archetype",width="450", link="images/devon-module-dev-guide/select-archetype.png"]

For the very first time, when we use archetype in Eclipse, it sometimes does not appear in the list of available archetypes. So in that case, use _"add archetype"_ button.

Once you select archetype, and press "_Next_" button, a dialog appears, where you need to put desired _artifactid_ and _group id_ and click finish button.
A new project is created on the basis of chosen archetype.

==== Creation of module through command line

To use command line, go to your devon distribution and run _console.bat_
Once the console is opened, execute the command:

[source , java]
----

mvn -DarchetypeVersion=dev-SNAPSHOT -DarchetypeGroupId=devonfw-archetype
-DarchetypeArtifactId=com.devonfw.dev archetype:generate
-DgroupId=com.devonfw.modules -DartifactId=samplemodule -Dversion=0.1-SNAPSHOT
-Dpackage=com.devonfw.modules.samplemodule

----

As, we are using Eclipse Neon version and it mandates the usage of java 8.
So, if you don't have the latest devon distribution and you want to use this archetype for the module creation, follow below steps:

1. When you use archetype with java version lower than java 8, project will be created and you will get error like: 

*_Unbound classpath container: 'JRE System Library [JavaSE-1.8]' in project {project_name}_*, you will have to manually point installed JRE to desired version. Please, refer https://github.com/devonfw/devon-guide/wiki/Compatibility-guide-for-Java7-Java8-and-Tomcat7-Tomcat8[here].

2. Once, the project is created and step 1 is done, you need to manually change the java version in _pom.xml_ to the desired java version. So, the generated _pom.xml_ would have version as shown below:

[source , java]
----
 <java.version>1.8</java.version>
----

Please, change it to

[source , java]
----
 <java.version>1.7</java.version>
----

Once, these 2 steps are done, then you can proceed with newly created project/module.


=== Structure of created module

Once, above steps are followed, created module structure would look like below:

image::images/devon-module-dev-guide/new-maven-module5.png["new-maven-module5",width="450", link="images/devon-module-dev-guide/new-maven-module5.png"]

Here are the details of the structure:

At the top level files descriptive of the project: a _pom.xml_ file. In addition, there are textual documents meant for the user to be able to read immediately on receiving the source: README.txt, LICENSE.txt, etc.

There are just two subdirectories of this structure: src and target. The only other directories that would be expected here are metadata like CVS, .git or .svn, and any subprojects in a multiproject build (each of which would be laid out as above).

The target directory is used to house all the output of the build.

The src directory contains all of the source material for building the project, its site and so on. It contains a subdirectory for each type: main for the main build artifact, test for the unit test code and resources, site and so on.


1. "first" is the maven multi module project. Lets say, you want to create a new module in this project using new module archetype.

2. "module" created using archetype.

3. "module[boot]" the whole structure like _src/main/java_ etc can be seen inside it.

4. Directory for the language java.

5. contains all the resources like .properties file etc. For example, _application.properties_.

6. Contains all test classes(.java), like junit etc.

7. Contains resources required for testing purposes.
