== Design Philosophy : Jump the Queue

image::images/jumpthequeue/scene.png[, link="images/jumpthequeue/scene.png"]

=== Introduction
When visiting public (free) or private (paid) events there are often large queues creating significant waiting times. Ideally the organizer of the event would like to streamline the entry of people. That would be possible by allowing people privileged access or, alternatively, offer an incentive for people to arrive in time or to get into line more efficiently. A way of doing this would be to have a website or application which would allow visitors to "Jump the Queue". This document describes the design for such an application: _“JumpTheQueue”_. 

[NOTE]
==== 
Note that the document is intended to reflect a hypothetical but real use case. The design reflects this by trying to be complete. But the implementation is simplified in order to serve as an example. Where implementation differs from design, this is noted with an icon or symbol like : =>  and a comment about the nature of the difference.

=== User Stories
----
As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >
----

==== Epic: Register Event
As a visitor to an event I want to be able to visit a website or use an app - called _JumpTheQueue_, which provides me with a code (and optional date/time) after registration so that I can get a privileged access to the event

===== User Story: register
As a user of _JumpTheQueue_, I want to register with my name and either Email, Phone number or both so that I comply with the requirements to obtain the access code
 
====== Acceptance Criteria
A full name is mandatory. Either Email, Phone or both can be given. These must be valid. Validation is a separate, asynchronous process. 

===== US: terms and conditions
As a user of _JumpTheQueue_, I accept that the organiser of the event can store my personal data so they can send me commercial notices (“spam”)

As a user of _JumpTheQueue_, I want to read the statement _“By pressing_ ‘Request it’ _you agree to the Terms and Conditions”_ so that I can implicitly agree to aforementioned terms & conditions.

===== US: List queued visitors
As a user of _JumpTheQueue_ I want to show the list of users ahead of me in the queue with optional data & time so I can see how long I have to wait and optionally at what time I have to appear at the access gate.
 
===== Etcetera
As a user of _JumpTheQueue_, I have to confirm either Email or Phone number by replying to a message send to the account if entered so the data can be verified.

====
=> this is not further developed nor implemented 
====
As a visitor , I want to go the the privileged access queue with my valid (i.e. validated) access code so I can get direct access.

=> this is not further developed nor implemented

=== UI

==== Flow

The basic flow of the application can be:

image::images/jumpthequeue/flow.png[, link="images/jumpthequeue/flow.png"]


* Fill in a form to give your name and private data and then press a button with “Register”
* In case of validation errors, an error message will be shown
* If there are no errors then an Access Code will be generated which will be shown on a next page. The access code can optionally be provided with proposed access time.
* From this page you can show a view of the current Queue, with the list of people queued

There must be a 1 - 1 relationship between a ProvidedAccessCode and an AccessCode.
