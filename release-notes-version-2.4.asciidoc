= Devonfw Release notes 2.4 “EVE”

image::images/release-notes-2.4/eve.jpg[width="680"]

== Introduction

We are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 2.4 (code named “EVE” during development). This version is the first one that fully embraces Open Source, including components like the documentation assets and Cobigen. Most of the IP (Intellectual Property or proprietary) part of devonfw are now published under the Apache License version 2.0 (with the documentation under the Creative Commons License (Attribution-NoDerivatives)). This includes the GitHub repositories where all the code and documentation is located. All of these repositories are now open for public viewing as well. 

“EVE” contains a slew of new features but in essence it is already driven by what we expect to be the core focus of 2018: strengthening the platform and improving quality.

This release is also fully focused on deepening the platform rather than expanding it. That is to say: we have worked on improving existing features rather than adding new ones and strengthen the qualitative aspects of the software development life cycle, i.e. security, testing, infrastructure (CI, provisioning) etc.

“EVE” already is very much an example of this. This release contains the Allure Test Framework (included as an incubator in version 2.3) update called MrChecker Test Framework. MrChecker is an automated testing framework for functional testing of web applications, API web services, Service Virtualization, Security and in coming future native mobile apps, and databases. All modules have tangible examples of how to build resilient integration test cases based on delivered functions. 

Another incubator being updated is the devonfw Shop Floor which intended to be a compilation of DevOps experiences from the Devonfw perspective. A new part of the release is the new Solution Guide for Application Security based on the state of the art in OWASP based application security. 

There is a whole range of new features and improvements which can be seen in that light. OASP4j 2.6 changes and improves the package structure of the core Java framework. The My Thai Star sample app has now been upgraded to Angular 6, lots of bugs have been fixed and the devonfw Guide has once again been improved.

=== AppSec Quick Solution Guide
 
This release incorporates a new Solution Guide for Application Security based on the state of the art in OWASP based application security. The purpose of this guide is to offer quick solutions for common application security issues for all applications based on devonfw.  It’s often the case that we need our systems to comply to certain sets of security requirements and standards. Each of these requirements needs to be understood, addressed and converted to code or project activity. We want this guide to prevent the wheel from being reinvented over and over again and to give clear hints and solutions to common security problems.

** Able to generate multiple output files per XML input file.
** Generating code from UML diagrams. XMI files (standard XML for UML) can be now read and processed. This means that you can develop templates and generate code from an XMI like class diagrams.
* CobiGen OpenAPI plugin released with multiple bug-fixes and other functionalities like:
** Assigning global and local variables is now possible. Therefore you can set any string for further processing on the templates. For instance, changing the root package name of the generated files. Documented here.
** Enabled having a class with more than one relationship to another class (more than one property of the same type).
