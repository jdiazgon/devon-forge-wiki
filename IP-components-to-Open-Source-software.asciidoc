== Steps to convert IP Software to Open Source Software 

* Choose right *Open Source License* for repository. Add a file named `LICENSE` to the root of repository (you can also do that automatically when creating the repo on github). In practice, that means that the https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0[Apache License version 2.0] will be applied. In specific cases it might also be https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT[MIT License] (please discuss with the community before choosing anything else than ASL2.0 for code). Documentation shall be licensed under Creative Commons License (by-nd) - see footer of this page for details.
* For Java Projects you also need to configure the same license in the `<licenses>` section of your top-level `pom.xml` (full requirements can be found http://central.sonatype.org/pages/requirements.html[here]).
* Check your source-code and dependencies for specific circumstances. Therefore check your dependencies for *NOTICE* files and verify that the entire source-code is officially owned by the copyright holder. In any such case add *NOTICE* to the root of repository that explains the circumstances. You can find here a https://www.apache.org/licenses/example-NOTICE.txt[sample file].
* Add *copyright statement* to all source code file. You can copy it from https://github.com/devonfw/devon/blob/develop/modules/SpringData/src/main/java/com/capgemini/devonfw/module/common/GenericRepository.java[this example]. For doing this there are multiple tools. We can use http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-copyright-generator[Eclipse Copyright Generator plugin] to do the same.
** This plugin adds a new Panel in the preferences (global or project based) with: `Menu > Windows > Preferences > General > Copyright`.
** A Menu `Menu > Project > Apply Copyright`. This wizard provide a lot of options and some default template for Open-Source licence. 
* Change copyright footer to include https://creativecommons.org/licenses/[Creative Commons License (Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International)]. Copy text from https://github.com/oasp-forge/oasp4j-wiki/wiki/_Footer/_edit[here].
* All source files should be *consistent* - follow same pattern for any usage so new contributor will follow the same.
* Make a list of libraries with its versions and license type. Check if license are fitting requirement for open source. 
* Create a document with any prerequisite setup. Also include examples wherever necessary.
* Add a https://github.com/devonfw/devon-guide/wiki/Contributing-Code-of-Conduct[Code Of Conduct]. TODO (JH): Do we need that per repository or should we simply create a CoC for entire devonfw?
* Add a https://github.com/devonfw/devon-guide/wiki/Contributing-Code[Contributing Guide] that gathers the following points: 
	1. How other developers can contribute to the project?
	2. https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue-template-for-your-repository/[Issue template] and https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository/[PR template] for Github repository. For example, Cobigen already has these templates https://github.com/devonfw/tools-cobigen/tree/master/.github[here].
        3. Process for code quality review.
	4. Process for continuous testing. 
 
* Apart from above points, everything from selecting a proper license, branding, naming individual authors, doing legal review, and potentially searching for patent infringement code should be factored in this step.
* Once all above steps are done we are ready to publish our Open Source Project. Create a public repository and push code here.
