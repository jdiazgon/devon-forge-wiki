.*Using devcon*
[NOTE]
You can automate the following steps using devcon with the `devon sencha run` command <<sencha run,learn more here>>

The following steps assume that you already have setup your Devon environment, and that you have the devonfw-sample-server running on a server on port 8081. Refer to the Devonfw Server documentation for instructions on how to setup the Devon environment or the devon sample application.

1. Open a Devon command prompt by executing the batch file `console.bat`.

1. Enter the `workspaces\examples\devon4sencha\ExtSample` directory

1. Execute the  the command `sencha app watch`. It might take some time the first time you run this command.
+
This command will compile the devon4sencha sample application and start a webserver to serve it and will automatically recompile the application if it detects any changes to the application's files.
+
On first run, you probably will see something similar to the image below. We do not distribute ExtJS itself with our sample application. Instead, the ExtJS SDK is downloaded on first use if not already available.

+
If you have a valid ExtJS license, you can simply copy the ExtJS 6 SDK into `workspaces\examples\devon4sencha\ext` and it will automatically get picked up.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you see an error while executing this command, first try to delete the local sencha repository located at `<DEVON ENVIRONMENT>\software\Sencha\Cmd\default\repo`. If there was a problem downloading the ExtJS SDK, the local repository sometimes gets stuck in a bad state, and the easiest solution is to just delete it, causing everything to be re-downloaded.
====

1. As soon as you see `Waiting for changes...`, the application has been compiled and is ready.

1. Open http://localhost:1841/ExtSample/[] in a browser. Use `waiter` as both user and password.
