== OASP4J and Spring Boot Configuration

An application needs to be configured in order to allow internal setup such as CDI (Context and Dependency Injection), but also to allow externalized configuration of a deployed package (e.g. integration into runtime environment). Using http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Boot], you can rely on a comprehensive configuration approach following a "convention over configuration" pattern. The Spring Boot guide adds on to this by detailed instructions and best-practices to deal with configurations.

In general, the kinds of configuration can be distinguished as explained in the following sections:

* xref:internal-application-configuration[Internal Application configuration] maintained by developers
* xref:environment-configuration[Externalized Environment configuration] maintained by the operators
* xref:business-configuration[Externalized Business configuration] maintained by business administrators

=== Internal Application Configuration

The application configuration contains all the internal settings and the wiring of the application (bean wiring, database mappings, etc.) and is maintained by the application developers at development time. Usually, there is a main configuration registered with the main Spring Boot App, but differing configurations to support automated test of the application can be defined using profiles (not detailed in this guide).

_web.xml_ is referred as a place for all the web related configurations, but now it is no more used to configure the web app. It is empty. Therefore, let's discuss how you can configure the Devon based on Spring Boot applications!

==== Standard beans configuration

For basic bean configuration, you can rely on spring boot, mainly using the configuration classes and occasionally xml-configuration files. Following are some of the key principles to understand Spring Boot auto-configuration features:

* Spring Boot auto-configuration attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the jar dependencies and annotated components found in your source code. 

* Auto-configuration is noninvasive, at any point you can start to define your own configuration to replace specific parts of the auto-configuration by redefining your identically named bean.
 
Beans are configured via annotations at the java-class (@Component, @Bean, @Named, etc.).
These beans will be known when wiring the application at runtime. The required component scan is already auto-enabled within the main SpringBootApp.

For beans that needs separate configuration for any reason, additional Configuration Classes (using annotation @Configuration) can be used and will be automatically evaluated during application startup. 

Lets see how you can customize your own Configuration Class

===== Step 1: Creating the Configuration Class

In Devon, the Configuration Classes reside in the folder `src/main/general/configuration/` and it's recommended to include the new Configuration Classes here. This is just to keep a clear structure of projects. In fact, you can include the Configuration Classes anywhere in the project, it is the responsibility of the Spring Boot to scan the application.

Therefore, to create your Configuration Class, for example _src/main/general/configuration/MyConfigurationClass.java_

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfigurationClass{
    public int     propertie1;
    public String  propertie2;
    public float   propertie3;
    
    private MyBean myBean;

    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() { 
       this.myBean= new MyBean(propertie1,propertie2,propertie3);
       return this.myBean;
    } 
}
----

With the annotation _@Configuration_ Spring Boot will manage your class as a configuration class.

===== Step 2: Including properties

In the last step, you have a Configuration Class that configures a simple bean (MyBean). Let's see how you can set values as per your configuration.

There are several ways of setting the parameter's value:

* Initialize the variable in the code.

[source,java]
----
(...)
public int     propertie1 = 0;
public String  propertie2 = "0";
public float   propertie3 = 0.0f;
(...)
----

Obviously, this is the simplest way to define the parameters, but isn't a good practice. Therefore, it is recommended to use some of the following ways to define the values in configuration.

* Using _@Value_ annotation and _application.properties_ file

First, you need to define the properties in the _application.properties_ file. You can define the properties in _/main/resources/application.properties_ or in _/main/resources/config/application.properties_. If you are running the server with the embedded Tomcat of the application, you can use both the files, but if you are deploying the application on an external Tomcat, you need to define your properties in the first one.

[source,java]
----
mybean.property1=0
mybean.property2=0
mybean.property3=0.0f
----

Finally, you can access the defined properties in the code using the _@Value_ annotation:
[source,java]
----
(...)
@Value("${mybean.property1}")
public int property1;

@Value("${mybean.property2}")
public String property2;

@Value("${mybean.property3}")
public float property3;
(...)
----

* Using _@ConfigurationProperties_ annotation and _application.properties_ file

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "mybean")
public class MyConfigurationClass{
    public int     property1;
    public String  property2;
    public float   property3;

//WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE GETTERS AND SETTERS OF THE VARIABLES
}
----

Now, Spring Boot maps the variables to the value of the properties under the prefix "mybean". Therefore, you just need to include these in the _application.properties_ file as you did in the _@Value_ example.


==== XML-based beans configuration

It is still possible and allowed to provide (bean-) the configurations using xml, though not recommended. These configuration files are no more bundled via a main xml config file but loaded individually from their respective owners, e.g. for unit-tests:

[source, java]
@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = { SpringBootApp.class }, locations = { "classpath:/config/app/batch/beans-productimport.xml" })
public class ProductImportJobTest extends AbstractSpringBatchIntegrationTest {
...

Configuration XML-files reside in an adequately named sub-folder of:

`src/main/resources/app`

==== Batch configuration

In the directory `src/main/resources/config/app/batch`, you can place the configuration file for the batch jobs. Each file within this directory represents one batch job.

==== WebSocket configuration

A websocket endpoint is configured within the business package as a Spring configuration class. The annotation _@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker_ makes Spring Boot registering this endpoint.
 
[source, java]
package io.oasp.gastronomy.restaurant.salesmanagement.websocket.config;
...
@Configuration
@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
public class WebSocketConfig extends AbstractWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {
...

=== Externalized Configuration

Externalized configuration is provided separately in a deployment package and can be maintained undisturbed by redeployments.

==== Environment Configuration

The environment configuration contains the configuration parameters (typically port numbers, host names, passwords, logins, timeouts, certificates, etc.) specifically for the different environments. These are under the control of the operators responsible for the application. 

The environment configuration is maintained in the `application.properties` files, defining various properties. 
These properties are explained in the corresponding configuration sections of the guides for each topic:

* <<Database System and Access,persistence configuration>>
* <<JAX-RS Configuration,service configuration>>
* <<Configuration,logging guide>>

There are two properties files exist within the example server:

* `src/main/resources/application.properties` provides a default configuration - bundled and deployed with the application package. It further acts as a template to derive a tailored minimal environment-specific configuration.
* `src/main/resources/config/application.properties` provides the additional properties only required at development time (for all local deployment scenarios). This property file is excluded from all packaging.

The location of the tailored _application.properties_ file after deployment depends on the deployment strategy:

* standalone runnable Spring Boot App using embedded tomcat: place a tailored copy of `application.properties` into `installpath/config/`
* dedicated tomcat (one tomcat per app): place a tailored copy of `application.properties` into `tomcat/lib/config`
* tomcat serving a number of apps (requires expanding the wars): place a tailored copy of _application.properties_ into the `tomcat/webapps/<app>/WEB-INF/classes/config`

In this `application.properties`, only define the minimum properties that are environment specific and inherit everything else from the bundled `src/main/resources/application.properties`. In any case, make sure that the class loader will find the file.

Also, assure that the properties are thoroughly documented by providing a comment to each property. This inline documentation is most valuable for your operations department. 

==== Business Configuration

The business configuration contains all business configuration values of the application, which can be edited by administrators through the GUI. The business configuration values are stored in the database in key/value pairs.

The database table `business_configuration` has the following columns:

* ID
* Property name
* Property type (Boolean, Integer, String)
* Property value
* Description

According to the entries in the above table, the administrative GUI shows a generic form to change business configuration. The hierarchy of the properties determines the place in the GUI, so the GUI bundles the properties from the same hierarchy level and name. `Boolean` values are shown as checkboxes, `integer` and `string` values as text fields. The properties are read and saved in a typed form, an error is raised if you try to save a `string` in an `integer` property, for example.

Following base layout is recommended for the hierarchical business configuration:

`component.[subcomponent].[subcomponent].propertyname`
