== Adding Content to the Index

On this page we'll give a tutorial on how the index works and how to contribute to our index at http://devonfw.github.io/devon-ide/oomph/index/org.eclipse.setup

=== Structure of the Index

==== The Index

The Index file (mostly named `org.eclipse.setup`) defines all available Product and Project Catalogs. For devon the index file can be found http://devonfw.github.io/devon-ide/oomph/index/org.eclipse.setup[here].

==== The Catalogs

There are two different kinds of Catalogs: the Product and the Project Catalogs. In this section we'll talk about the Product Catalog since the Project Catalog works in the exact same way.

A Product Catalog contains the Product setup files. Furthermore tasks that are shared across all Products can be defined here. In case of the devon Product Catalog those are the p2 plugins for the Oomph tasks and the general _Installation_ task that triggers the installation of a product.

The devon Product Catalog can be found http://devonfw.github.io/devon-ide/oomph/products/catalog_devonfw.setup[here].

The devon Project Catalog can be found http://devonfw.github.io/devon-ide/oomph/projects/catalog_devonfw.setup[here].

==== The Content

Product and Project setup files are described in <<IDE Setup with the Oomph Installer,Setup of the devon-ide with oomph>>

=== Adding a Catalog to the Index

To add a Catalog located at `http://your/catalog.setup` to the devon Index you add

[source,xml]
----
<productCatalog href="http://your/catalog.setup#/"/>
----
or

[source,xml]
----
<projectCatalog href="http://your/catalog.setup#/"/>
----
to the https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/blob/master/docs/oomph/index/org.eclipse.setup[devon Index file]. This file

=== Adding a Product or a Project to a Catalog

Similar to adding a Catalog to the index you can add an Product or Project to a Catalog. You can only add Projects to a Project Catalog and Products to a Product Catalog.

In case of devon products and projects they're stored at `oomph/{products, projects}` of their corresponding repositories gh-pages.

To add e.g. a Product at `http://devonfw.github.io/oomph/products/your-product.setup` to the devon Index you add

[source,xml]
----
<product href="http://devonfw.github.io/oomph/products/your-product.setup#/"/>
----

////
TODO: fix link
////
to the https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/blob/master/docs/oomph/products/catalog_devonfw.setup[devon Product Catalog file].

To add a Project add

[source,xml]
----
<project href="http://devonfw.github.io/oomph/projects/your-project.setup#/"/>
----

////
TODO: fix link
////
to the https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/blob/master/docs/oomph/projects/catalog_devonfw.setup[devon Project Catalog file].
