== Porting of Eclipse to Eclipse Neon Version.

* Download the last stable version of IDE from https://coconet.capgemini.com/sf/go/projects.apps2_devon/frs.oasp4j_ide[here].

* Eclipse neon mandates use of Java8, so first replace java folder of software folder of distribution with java8.

* Download eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/neonr[here] according to OS.

* Once installer is downloaded , double click it and click run.

* Please follow the steps as shown in below images.

For installing , eclipse neon, we need to hook off bundle pool option, so that no absolute path of the machine is introduced in config files of eclipse.

== Bundle pools
 
Eclipse's p2 technology supports the concept of a bundle pool. Bundle pools help to dramatically reduce disk footprint and to eliminate repeated downloads of the same bundles and features, thereby dramatically improving the performance of software updates and target platform provisioning. Oomph makes heavy use of this technology for both its p2 tasks and it targlet tasks. Further, Oomph provides a technology layer on top of p2 to improve the behavior and performance of caching allowing Oomph to provide offline support for installing and updating installations and target platforms. 
For more info , refer https://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Getting_Started#Bundle_pooling[here]

But as we are creating distribution zip, and the aim is the user does not need to install n number of softwares needed for use of  devon framework,we provide an initial set up which is good to go with, we hook off the bundle pool option of eclipse installer, so that we get all the eclipse folders in the desired location and not in home directories.As, making the bundle pool option on, creates entries of local paths in config files of eclipse, which does not make eclipse to work on other machines except the one where its installed.
