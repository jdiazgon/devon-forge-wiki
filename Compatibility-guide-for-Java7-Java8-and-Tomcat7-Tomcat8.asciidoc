== Compatibility guide for JAVA and TOMCAT

=== What this guide contains

As, we have migrated to eclipse neon, which mandatorily uses _Java8_, if any project or user wants to use _JAVA7_, this guide will assist to do so.
We also have integrated _TOMCAT8_ with the Devon distribution and oasp4j IDE. Therefore, it also describes the steps required to use _Tomcat7_ with the distributions.

=== Using JAVA7

==== Download JAVA7
One can download java7 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[here].
Once java7 is downloaded, run .exe and follow instructions.

==== Change installed jre in eclipse

When you open the eclipse, follow the below steps to change installed jre preferences:

===== 1. Go to Preferences

After following the above instructions, you can import projects or create new ones, and build using java7.

=== Using java8
One can use distribution as is, and there is no extra configuration needed for java8.

=== Using Tomcat8

As mentioned earlier in the guide, distribution comes with _Tomcat8_ by default, so no changes are required to run the applications with _tomcat8_.

=== Using Tomcat7 for deploying

You can download tomcat externally and deploy war in it.
For more information, please visit this <<Deploy on Tomcat,link>>.

=== Linux and Windows Compatibility

So, the above mentioned steps on _java7 and tomcat7_ compatibility, apply to devonfw distributions of Windows OS as well as  Linux.

Linux and Windows distribution works by default on *JAVA8* and *TOMCAT8*.
