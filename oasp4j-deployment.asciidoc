== OASP4J Deployment

As we already mentioned when <<OASP4J Application Structure,introducing the oasp4j projects>>, the apps created with the _Oasp4j_ archetype are going to provide, apart from the _core_ project, a _server_ project that will configure the packaging of the app. 

In our _Jump the Queue_ app we can verify that we have this _server_ project available

image::images/oasp4j/9.Deployment/jumpthequeue_server_structure.png[width="250", link="images/oasp4j/9.Deployment/jumpthequeue_server_structure.png"]

So, using _Maven_, we are going to be able to easily package our app in a _.war_ file to be deployed in an application server like _Tomcat_ (the default server provided in Devonfw).

=== The _server_ Project

The _server_ project provided in _Oasp4j_ applications is an almost empty _Maven_ project. It only has a _pom.xml_ file that is used to configure the packaging of the _core_ project. Taking a closer look to this _pom.xml_ file we can realize that it only presents a single dependency to the core project. 

[source,xml]
----
...

<dependencies>
<dependency>
    <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>jumpthequeue-core</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
...

----

And then it includes the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html[spring-boot-maven-plugin] that allows us to package the project in a jar or war archives and run the application "in-place".

[source,xml]
----
...

<plugins>
    <plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    ...

----

=== Running the app with Maven

So thanks to _Spring Boot_ and the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` we can run our app using Maven. To do so just open a command line with access to _Maven_ (in Devonfw we can do it using the _console.bat_). And:

1.- As is explained in https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/getting-started-understanding-oasp4j-spring-boot-config#step-2-including-properties[devon documentation] the `application.properties` used for packaging is `/src/main/resources/application.properties`. So we need to edit the app properties to access to the app. In `/jumpthequeue-core/src/main/resources/application.properties` configure the properties

----
server.port=8081
server.context-path=/jumpthequeue
----

2.- install the `jumpthequeue/core` project in our local _Maven_ repository

----
D:\Devon-dist\...\jumpthequeue>mvn install
----

3.- Go to the `jumpthequeue/server` project and execute the command `mvn spring-boot:run`

----
D:\Devon-dist\...\jumpthequeue\server>mvn spring-boot:run
----

The app should be launched in the _Spring Boot_ embedded Tomcat server. Wait a few seconds until you see a console message like

----
[L: org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.tomcat.TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer] - [M: Tomcat started on port(s): 8081 (http)]
[L: com.cap.jumpthequeue.SpringBootApp] - [M: Started SpringBootApp in 17.908 seconds (JVM running for 19.148)]
----

Now we can try to access to the app resource (GET)`http://localhost:8081/jumpthequeue/services/rest/visitormanagement/v1/visitor/1` we can verify that the app is running fine

=== Packaging the app with Maven

In the same way, using _Maven_ we can package our project in a _.war_ file. As in the previous section, open a command line with access to _Maven_ (in Devonfw _console.bat_ script) and execute the command `mvn clean package` in the project root directory

----
D:\Devon-dist\...\jumpthequeue>mvn clean package
----

The packaging process (compilation, tests and _.war_ file generation) should be launched. Once the process is finished you should see a result like

----

queue-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war

The packaging process has created a _.war_ file that has been stored in the `jumpthequeue\server\target` directory.

=== Deploying the war file on Tomcat

After packaging the app with _Maven_, we have the _.war_ file containing our app. In addition, Devonfw provides us with a _Tomcat_ server ready to be used, so let's deploy the application in that _Tomcat_ server.

1. Go to `jumpthequeue\server\target` directory. You should find a `jumpthequeue-server-{version}.war` there.

2. Change the _.war_ name to something easier like `jumpthequeue.war`

3. Copy the just renamed file to the _Tomcat_'s _webapps_ directory (located in `Devon-dist\software\tomcat\webapps`).

4. Go to `Devon-dist\software\tomcat\bin` directory and execute the `startup.bat` script to launch _Tomcat_.

A new command window will be opened. Wait until the starting process is finished, you should see a message like

----
Server startup in 31547 ms
----

The app will be available in the url `http://localhost:8080/{war-file-name}`

[NOTE]
====
The access to the server is done by default through port `8080`. If you want the app to be available through other port edit it in the `D:\Devon-dist\software\tomcat\conf\server.xml` file.
====

Now, if we try to access to the app with the simplest resource (GET)`http://localhost:8080/jumpthequeue/services/rest/visitormanagement/v1/visitor/1` we can verify that the app has been successfully deployed on _Tomcat_
