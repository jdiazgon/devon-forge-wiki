== Application structure

OASP4Fn provides **Infraestructure as Code**. For that reason, the service made with OASP4Fn must follow a **specified folder structure**, that along with a configuration file will allow the user to avoid having to configure the service manually. 

----
/handlers
	/Http
		/get
			handler1.ts
			handler2.ts
			…
			handlerN.ts
		/post
			handler1.ts
			handler2.ts
		/put
			…
	/S3
	...
----

In general every handler should follow the following structure:
----
	/{EventName}
		/{TriggerMethod}
			{HandlerName}.ts
----

The logic of the application will be stored in a folder, called **handlers**, inside it there will be a folder for each event used to trigger the handler and inside a folder with the name of the method that triggers the handler.
